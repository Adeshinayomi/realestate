           <h2>HOW TO MAKE YOUR RENTAL PROPERTY MORE ATTRACTIVE</h2>
           <p>
            The property market is a fickle mistress with trends being bucked positively and negatively depending on location. It is hard to know what is around the corner with no crystal ball, but no matter what, the show must go on!
            <br>
 
            <br>
            There are always tenants looking for property and sometimes in a saturated market we need to make a property stand out to be let quickly to the right tenant.
           </p>

           <h1> HOW TO MAKE YOUR RENTAL PROPERTY MORE ATTRACTIVE</h1>
           <p>
            So, what can you do to make your property stand out from the Crowd and make it more attractive for tenants? Here are some of our top tips to stand out from the crowd;
           </p>

          <ul>

            <li>
              <h4>Clean it!</h4>
              <p>
                Providing the property cleaned to a commercial standard will always make it look as good as it can. Cleanliness is a huge factor in whether or not a tenant will rent a property. First impressions are always important especially for your property. Having a cleaner attend to complete the job may cost a little bit of money but they will almost always find a little nook or cranny that can be wiped down and cleaned up to make your property perfect.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Look after it!</h4>
              <p>
                Maintenance is an important aspect of a tenant’s decision to rent a property. If the property looks tired and isn’t looked after tenants will opt for the next property that is. Regular maintenance during tenancies or in void periods is invaluable, it shows you care and will allow the property to stay at it’s best. Painting and replacing tired or worn items serves to improve your property and keep it as good as it can be.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Have good photos taken</h4>
              <p>
                Presentation is important, and it is a good idea to have the property as clutter free and as bright as possible so that the photos will be taken in the best light. Having photos taken professionally is always recommended so that each room and area is shown as well as it can be for advertising. This is all part of the service when you instruct Bluestone Properties as your letting or management agency.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <h4>Sell the tenancy</h4>
              <p>
                We treat each viewing as a sales pitch for the property and walk potential tenants round the property showing them each of the key features and providing relevant information. We don’t just talk about the property we know the areas as well, so we can make reference to transport links, amenities and other bonus points to generate interest. Preparation is key and knowing not just the property, but the area makes the experience all the more positive for potential tenants.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Upgrade</h4>
              <p>
                It is inevitable that through time windows, heaters, boilers, furniture, white goods and other items in the property will suffer degradation through normal use. Seek to replace items when an item breaks – sometimes repairing it can cost a significant amount of money with little guarantee that an item will last even when repaired.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Gas Heating</h4>
              <p>
                Approximately a quarter of the residential properties in London are rented and four out of five properties have gas central heating. If there is ever an opportunity to upgrade a heating system, why not consider gas central heating (where gas is available). It is considered to be more efficient and is always seen more favourably by potential tenants. If gas isn’t available investing in good quality electric heaters could make the difference for potential tenants.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Inspect regularly</h4>
              <p>
                Once a tenant is in suit, it is important to respect their right to quiet enjoyment, however it is important to make sure you get the opportunity to review and inspect the property. We recommend inspecting after 3 months and based on the outcome of that inspection we recommend doing it on an interim basis thereafter. This allows you to maintain a relationship with your tenants and allows you to stay on top of the cleanliness and maintenance as required.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Set aside funds for a rainy day</h4>
              <p>
                It is a good idea to keep some of your income aside to make sure you have enough funds to deal with any unforeseen issues. This allows you to react quickly to prevent further degradation of the property where necessary.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Use an excellent letting agent</h4>
              <p>
                This is where we come in, we provide a bespoke service, treating your property as if it were our own. We are here to work with you to make sure you get what you want out of it. We strive to make sure the property is maintained and looked after by building relationships with our tenants. We offer very competitive fees and are happy to go over these with you whilst providing you with a free valuation of your rental properties. Please get in touch for more information. 
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul> 

          <ul>
            <h2>STANDING OUT AFTER YOU HAVE A TENANT</h2>
            <li>
              By doing all of this you will be a great Landlord, you are being proactive in your approach and this will be appreciated and recognised by your tenants.
            </li>
            <li>
              By maintaining your property during tenancies and looking after your tenants they will respect you and your property and keep it as perfect as they possibly can
            </li>
            <li>
              A good relationship with your tenant is as important as anything in keeping your property maintained and therefore standing out from the crowd
